party playlist:
searches tracks for factors like danceability, enery, and valence
the goal is to find high energy songs that are positive and easy to dance to
looks for songs that:
-have high energy (>= .7)
-are easy to dance to(high danceability score) (>= .7)

study playlist:
searches tracks for factors like energy, speechiness, and valence
looks for songs that:
-have low-mid energy (< 0.5)
-are not strongly positive or negative(mid valence score) (0.4 - 0.7)
-have low-mid speechiness(not too many words) (less than 0.15)

gym playlist:
searches tracks for just energy because the type of gym playlist i want to generate here should be high in energy
but i may want to search tracks for a low valence score, because a high energy negative song may make sense
-high energy (> .8)
-maybe low valence ( < .4)

crying playlist:
searches tracks for valence
looks for songs that:
-are sad or negative(low valence score)
